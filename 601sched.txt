Exam 1 - Oct. 5
Exam 2 - Nov. 16
Presentations - Nov. 28-30
(Group presentations are OK.)

Exams will tend to have several applied problems. First exam will be more math based, second is more applied.

Project will be an applied Bayesian modeling exercise. Find data; use methods slightly more advanced than in class (e.g. different prior in computation). Use data that don't fit in perfectly with what we discuss in class.
